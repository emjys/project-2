# Project 2: DoAP

DoAP is a website designed for the dog-owners / lovers to post photographs of their dog pets.

General public can report dog-fouling by uploading photograph and provide details for the relevant department to investigate. This is to promote and encourage social community engagement to help maintain better surrounding and environment.
